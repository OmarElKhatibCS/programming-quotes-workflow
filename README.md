# Description

this workflow will update your README with a programming quote every day.<br>
static_template should be the original README . <br>
this is a project for the github hackathons on dev.to , my post can be found [here](https://dev.to/elkhatibomar/generate-programming-quotes-in-readme-every-day-2g56)

# How it works?

the script will generate a quote for you then he will create a new README using the static one plus the quote.
***

quote of the day :
Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. -Rich Cook
