# Description

this workflow will update your README with a programming quote every day.<br>
static_template should be the original README . <br>
this is a project for the github hackathons on dev.to , my post can be found [here](https://dev.to/elkhatibomar/generate-programming-quotes-in-readme-every-day-2g56)

# How it works?

the script will generate a quote for you then he will create a new README using the static one plus the quote.
***

quote of the day :
The problem with object-oriented languages is theyâ€™ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. -Joe Armstrong (programmer)
